# HeyOSJ

I have been working on my CSS lately and figured it might be a good time to redo my portfolio to show off my new React project I've been working on. I liked the design of my last portfolio but felt it was a bit busy and responsiveness needed major improvement.

# The Design

### Layout

I went for a mobile first approach, which admitedly was new for me. After trying it out, I understand the value in it. I will continue this practice.

### Colors

I wanted to use the same colors that were in my svgs. Most importantly I did not want to go with a strictly white background or strictly black so I went for colors that were a bit warm and flat.

### Typography

For fonts I chose two that I really liked. For all the titles I went with Poppins, and everything else I went with Montserrat.

### SVGs

I built these SVGs with Affinity Designer, this was my first time building anything with this type of software but it was pretty fun creating these thing.

## Code

### Languages Used

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript

### Externals

-   Font Awesome for icons
-   Google Fonts

### CSS

I wanted to work on specificity, turned out to be a lot more writing than intened but did nice readable look.

I also went with variables as can be seen here.

### JS

The bulk of the JavaScript is being used here to pull my GitHub repos to searve in the additional projects area. The thought behind this was that as I create more repos the portfolio would update itself.

### Performance

I ran several lighthouse audits to see which areas could use improvements. Here is when I realized the importance in Accessibilty (which the red in my svgs don't help much so expect an improvement to come for that) as well as minifying my CSS code.

##### Thanks for taking the time to read this!
